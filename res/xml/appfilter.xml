    <!-- Icons are themed by specifiy their activity component name and the drawable to replace it with -->

    <!-- Replace phone icon on Nexus/AOSP devices -->
    <item component="ComponentInfo{com.android.contacts/.activities.DialtactsActivity}" drawable="ic_phone_red" />
    <!-- Phone on On HTC 4.0 devices -->
    <item component="ComponentInfo{com.android.htccontacts/.DialerTabActivity}" drawable="ic_phone_red" />
    <!-- Phone on Sony devices -->
    <item component="ComponentInfo{com.sonyericsson.android.socialphonebook/.DialerEntryActivity}" drawable="ic_phone_red" />

    <!-- Alternatively,
         Nova Launcher maintains an internal database of common system icons to theme.
         For example the :PHONE line below does the same as all the lines above.
         Note that only non-Play Store system apps are included in this, third-party apps,
         or Play Store apps such as Chrome, will not be included and must be themed manually.

         The advantage to using Nova's database is that it likely covers more devices/roms
         than you would otherwise, and future updates of Nova Launcher can support
         future devices/roms as well.

         The disadvantage is that other launchers do not support it and in some cases
         you may be able to update your theme for a new device before Nova Launcher is.

         If desired you can use both methods, allowing Nova to catch any you miss or your
         ComponentInfo lines to catch any that Nova misses.
